#Human Activity Recognition of WiFi Signals Based on Stacked Group Convolutional Sparse Attention
This repository provides a deep learning framework specifically designed for identifying human activities through WiFi signals. It supplements our research paper titled "Human Activity Recognition Based on Probabilistic Sparse Attention and Enhanced Group Convolutional WiFi Signals" in a comparative experiment. Once our manuscript is published, the code will be made public.

Code changed from https://github.com/xyanchen/WiFi-CSI-Sensing-Benchmark It supports three common datasets: NTU Fi HAR, NTU Fi HumanID, and UT_HAR_data, with the optional model ResNet18, ResNet50，GRU，BiLSTM，ViT。 To start the program, simply execute "Python run. py -- model [model name] -- dataset [dataset name]", for example: Python run. py -- model BiLSTM -- dataset NTU Fi_HAR. The dataset and source code can refer to the WiFi CSI Sensing Benchmark（ https://github.com/xyanchen/WiFi-CSI-Sensing-Benchmark ).
