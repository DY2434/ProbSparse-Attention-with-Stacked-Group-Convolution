#  Human Activity Recognition using WiFi Signals based on Sparse Attention with Stacked Group Convolution
This repository offers a deep learning framework tailored for human activity recognition via WiFi signals. It complements our research paper titled "Human activity recognition using WiFi Signals based on probabilistic sparse attention with enhanced group convolution." The code will be publicly accessible once our manuscript is published.

For ease of use, the code is compatible with two public datasets: NTU-Fi HAR and NTU-Fi-HumanID. To initiate the program, simply execute the "run.py" file. Dataset can be downloaded via [WiFi-CSI-Sensing-Benchmark](https://github.com/xyanchen/WiFi-CSI-Sensing-Benchmark).
