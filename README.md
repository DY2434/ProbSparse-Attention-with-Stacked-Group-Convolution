#  Prob-Sparse Attention with Stacked Group Convolution for Wireless Signal-based Human Activity Recognition
This repository offers a deep learning framework tailored for human activity recognition using WiFi signals. It complements our research paper titled "Prob-Sparse Attention with Stacked Group Convolution for Wireless Signal-based Human Activity Recognition". The code will be publicly accessible once our manuscript is published.

For ease of performance comparison, the code is compatible with two public datasets: NTU-Fi HAR and NTU-Fi-HumanID. To initiate the program, simply execute the "run.py" file. Dataset can be downloaded via [WiFi-CSI-Sensing-Benchmark](https://github.com/xyanchen/WiFi-CSI-Sensing-Benchmark).
